# OMS

An Orbital Mechanics Simulation tool/library. Currently, just a simple N-body simulation with leapfrog integration.

## Planned features

- Account for relativistic effects
- More numerically stable integrator
- Visualiser
- Hardware acceleration
- Condition satisfaction detection (i.e: "how long until the next solar eclipse?")

## Example Solar System

```
cargo run --example solar-system
```
